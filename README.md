# Energy-Efficient Transfer Learning for Water Consumption Forecasting 🚀 

## Overview 📌

This repository contains the implementation of a transfer learning approach for water consumption forecasting, aimed at reducing computational time, energy consumption, and CO₂ emissions. The project builds upon pre-trained deep learning models originally designed for electricity consumption prediction, leveraging similarities between both tasks to improve forecasting efficiency in water management systems.

💡 Why it matters? AI is transforming industries, including water utilities, by optimizing resource management. However, AI models often require significant computational resources, leading to high energy consumption and environmental impact. This work proposes an energy-efficient deep learning methodology that mitigates these challenges by using transfer learning techniques.

 ## Key Features ✨

- ✔️ Transfer Learning for Sustainability: Adapts pre-trained deep learning models from electricity consumption forecasting to the water consumption domain, reducing training costs.  
- ✔️ Energy-Efficient AI: Minimizes computational resources, lowering power consumption and CO₂ emissions.  
- ✔️ Scalability: Evaluates the method’s ability to handle large datasets efficiently.  
- ✔️ Performance Benchmarking: Compares the proposed model against state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods.  
- ✔️ Real-World Application: Validated using real consumption data from a Spanish water utility company.

 ## Usage ⚙️

This methodology is adaptable to various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, as well as different types of data. The general workflow is as follows:  
- 1️⃣ Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the dataset (see DATA and ETL folders).  
- 2️⃣ Model Training: Utilize a pre-trained DL model originally designed for electricity consumption forecasting (see DL folder).  
- 3️⃣ Transfer Learning Application: Fine-tune the pre-trained model for water consumption forecasting.  
- 4️⃣ Performance Evaluation: Compare results with other forecasting models, analyzing accuracy, computational efficiency, and energy consumption.  
- 5️⃣ Scalability Analysis: Assess the ability of the model to handle increasing data volumes.

📌 The script main.py provides a step-by-step workflow for executing the methodology. It can be modified to accommodate different datasets or forecasting models.

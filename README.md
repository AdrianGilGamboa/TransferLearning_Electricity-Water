# Energy-Efficient Transfer Learning for Water Consumption Forecasting üöÄ 

## Overview üìå

This repository contains the implementation of a transfer learning approach for water consumption forecasting, aimed at reducing computational time, energy consumption, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions. The project builds upon pre-trained deep learning models originally designed for electricity consumption prediction, leveraging similarities between both tasks to improve forecasting efficiency in water management systems.

### Why it matters?  üí°
AI is transforming industries, including water utilities, by optimizing resource management.
